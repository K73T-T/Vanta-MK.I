# ðŸ”§ Modifications I Made:
Redesigned the output shaft to resemble that of a standard NEMA 17 motor.

Made the shaft a separate part that threads into the output gear for horizontal printing and improved strength.

Adjusted the mounting pattern to match NEMA 17 hole spacing for direct compatibility with standard brackets.

Replaced the original threaded insert sizes with M3 headset inserts.
