# I modified the Gearbox by modifying the output shaft to be more like the shaft on a Nema 17 motor and made the shaft a separate part that threads into the output gear so it can be printed horizontally for more strength. I also changed the mounting holes to match the hole pattern of a Nema 17 so it can be mounted to brackets meant for the Nema 17 without an adapter and changed the threaded inserts to be M3 headset inserts.
